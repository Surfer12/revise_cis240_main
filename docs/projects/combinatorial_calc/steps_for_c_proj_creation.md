**1. Create Header Files**

Header files in C (and C++) are crucial for organizing your code and making it modular. They act as interfaces, declaring what functionalities are available in your implementation files without exposing the actual implementation details.

*   **ðŸ”² alu.h - ALU interface**
    *   **What it is:** `alu.h` will be the header file for your Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is the heart of your CPU when it comes to performing calculations and logical operations.
    *   **Purpose:** This file will define the *interface* to your ALU.  Think of it as a contract. It tells other parts of your code (specifically, `cpu.c`) what operations the ALU can perform and how to use them.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **Function Prototypes:** Declarations of functions that the ALU will implement. These functions will represent the different operations your ALU can perform, such as:
            *   `int alu_add(int operand1, int operand2);`  (Addition)
            *   `int alu_subtract(int operand1, int operand2);` (Subtraction)
            *   `int alu_and(int operand1, int operand2);` (Logical AND)
            *   `int alu_or(int operand1, int operand2);`  (Logical OR)
            *   `int alu_xor(int operand1, int operand2);` (Logical XOR)
            *   `int alu_shift_left(int operand, int shift_amount);` (Left Shift)
            *   `int alu_shift_right(int operand, int shift_amount);` (Right Shift)
            *   `int alu_compare(int operand1, int operand2);` (Comparison - might set flags)
        *   **Constants (Macros or `enum`s):**  You might define constants to represent ALU operation codes if you want to use a single ALU function that takes an operation code as input (though separate functions as above are often clearer for a simple simulator). You might also define constants for flags (like zero flag, carry flag, etc.) if your ALU will set status flags.
        *   **Data Structures (if needed):** For a simple ALU, you might not need complex data structures in the header. However, if you were building a more complex ALU with internal state, you might define structures here.
    *   **Why it's important:**  `alu.h` promotes modularity. The CPU implementation (`cpu.c`) can use the ALU functions declared in `alu.h` without needing to know *how* those operations are implemented. This separation makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and test.

*   **ðŸ”² cpu.h - CPU interface and state definitions**
    *   **What it is:** `cpu.h` is the header file for your Central Processing Unit (CPU) simulator. This is where you define the overall structure and behavior of your simulated CPU.
    *   **Purpose:**  Similar to `alu.h`, `cpu.h` defines the interface to your CPU and also importantly, defines the *state* of your CPU.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **CPU State Definition:** This is crucial. You need to define a `struct` (or similar) to represent the internal state of your CPU. This state typically includes:
            *   **Registers:**  Simulated CPU registers (e.g., general-purpose registers like `R0`, `R1`, `R2`, etc., program counter `PC`, stack pointer `SP`, status register/flags register). You'll need to decide how many registers your simulated CPU will have and what their names/identifiers will be.
            *   **Memory (optional in `cpu.h` but related):** While memory might be managed separately, you might include a pointer or structure related to the simulated memory within your CPU state if the CPU directly manages memory.
            *   **Flags/Status Register:**  Bits that indicate the result of operations (e.g., zero flag, carry flag, negative flag, overflow flag).
        *   **Function Prototypes:** Declarations of functions that represent the CPU's operations. These will likely include:
            *   `void cpu_initialize(CPUState *cpu);` (Function to initialize the CPU state to a known starting point)
            *   `void cpu_fetch_instruction(CPUState *cpu);` (Fetches the next instruction from memory based on the PC)
            *   `void cpu_decode_instruction(CPUState *cpu);` (Decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation and operands)
            *   `void cpu_execute_instruction(CPUState *cpu);` (Executes the decoded instruction, potentially using the ALU)
            *   `void cpu_step(CPUState *cpu);` (Executes a single instruction cycle - often combines fetch, decode, execute)
            *   `void cpu_load_program(CPUState *cpu, const Instruction *program, int program_size);` (Function to load a program into the simulated memory)
            *   `void cpu_run(CPUState *cpu);` (Function to run the program until a halt condition is met)
        *   **Data Structures (for instructions, memory, etc.):** You might define structures to represent instructions, memory addresses, or other CPU-related data. For example, you might define an `Instruction` struct to represent the format of instructions your CPU will execute.
        *   **Constants (Macros or `enum`s):**  Constants for instruction opcodes, register identifiers, memory addresses, etc.

**2. Create Implementation Files**

Implementation files (`.c` files) contain the actual code that *implements* the functions declared in your header files.

*   **ðŸ”² alu.c - ALU operations implementation**
    *   **What it is:** This file will contain the C code that defines *how* the ALU operations (declared in `alu.h`) are actually performed.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide the concrete implementation of the ALU's functionality.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **Implementations of functions declared in `alu.h`:**  For each function prototype in `alu.h`, you'll write the C code to perform the corresponding operation. For example:
            ```c
            #include "alu.h" // Include the header file

            int alu_add(int operand1, int operand2) {
                return operand1 + operand2;
            }

            int alu_subtract(int operand1, int operand2) {
                return operand1 - operand2;
            }
            // ... and so on for other ALU operations
            ```
        *   **Helper functions (if needed):** You might create internal helper functions within `alu.c` to assist with the implementation of more complex ALU operations.

*   **ðŸ”² cpu.c - CPU core functionality**
    *   **What it is:** This file will contain the core logic of your CPU simulator. It's where you implement the fetch-decode-execute cycle and manage the CPU's state.
    *   **Purpose:** To bring your simulated CPU to life by implementing its instruction processing logic.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **Implementations of functions declared in `cpu.h`:** You'll implement the functions like `cpu_initialize`, `cpu_fetch_instruction`, `cpu_decode_instruction`, `cpu_execute_instruction`, `cpu_step`, `cpu_load_program`, and `cpu_run`.
        *   **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle Logic:** This is the heart of `cpu.c`. You'll implement the logic for:
            *   **Fetch:**  Retrieving the instruction from simulated memory at the address pointed to by the Program Counter (PC).
            *   **Decode:**  Parsing the fetched instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved (registers, immediate values, memory addresses). This will likely involve looking at the opcode and operand fields of the instruction.
            *   **Execute:**  Performing the operation specified by the decoded instruction. This will often involve:
                *   Using the ALU (calling functions from `alu.h` and `alu.c`) for arithmetic and logical operations.
                *   Accessing and updating CPU registers.
                *   Reading from and writing to simulated memory (if your instructions involve memory access).
                *   Updating the Program Counter (PC) to point to the next instruction (or to a branch target if the instruction is a branch).
                *   Setting status flags based on the results of operations.
        *   **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Implementation:**  You'll need to implement the behavior of each instruction in your defined ISA (Instruction Set Architecture - which you've started with `isa.h`).  This means writing code within the `cpu_decode_instruction` and `cpu_execute_instruction` functions to handle each opcode defined in `isa.h`.
        *   **Memory Management (if handled within CPU):** If your CPU implementation directly manages memory, you'll have code here to simulate memory reads and writes.

*   **ðŸ”² main.c - Program entry point and test program**
    *   **What it is:** `main.c` is the standard entry point for a C program. In your case, it will be the program that *uses* your CPU simulator.
    *   **Purpose:** To create a test environment for your CPU simulator, load a program into it, run the simulation, and potentially display results or debug information.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **`main()` function:** The main function where program execution begins.
        *   **CPU Initialization:** Code to create an instance of your `CPUState` structure and initialize it using `cpu_initialize()`.
        *   **Program Loading:** Code to define a simple test program (a sequence of instructions) and load it into the simulated CPU's memory using `cpu_load_program()`.  This test program will be written in the assembly language of your simulated CPU (as defined by your ISA).
        *   **Simulation Execution:** Code to run the CPU simulation. This might involve calling `cpu_run()` to execute the entire program or `cpu_step()` in a loop to step through instructions one by one for debugging.
        *   **Output and Debugging:** Code to display the state of the CPU (registers, memory, flags) after the simulation or at various points during execution. This is crucial for verifying that your simulator is working correctly. You might use `printf` statements to output register values, memory contents, etc.

**3. Create Build System**

A build system automates the process of compiling your code and linking it into an executable program.

*   **ðŸ”² Makefile - For building the project**
    *   **What it is:** A `Makefile` is a configuration file used by the `make` utility. `make` is a build automation tool that reads the `Makefile` and executes commands to compile and link your code.
    *   **Purpose:** To simplify and automate the build process. Without a `Makefile`, you would have to manually type out compilation commands every time you make changes to your code.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **Variables:**  Variables to define compiler (e.g., `CC = gcc`), compiler flags (e.g., `CFLAGS = -Wall -g`), and other settings.
        *   **Targets:** Rules that define how to build different parts of your project. Common targets include:
            *   `all`:  The default target, usually to build the entire project (the executable).
            *   `clean`:  To remove compiled files (object files, executable) so you can rebuild from scratch.
        *   **Dependencies:**  Rules that specify which files depend on other files. For example, `cpu.o` (the object file for `cpu.c`) depends on `cpu.c` and `cpu.h`. `main.o` depends on `main.c` and `cpu.h` (and potentially `alu.h` and `isa.h`).
        *   **Commands:**  The actual commands to compile and link your code. These commands will use the compiler (`gcc` in this case) and compiler flags you defined.
    *   **Example Snippet (very basic):**
        ```makefile
        CC = gcc
        CFLAGS = -Wall -g

        all: cpu_simulator

        cpu_simulator: main.o cpu.o alu.o
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o cpu_simulator main.o cpu.o alu.o

        main.o: main.c cpu.h
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

        cpu.o: cpu.c cpu.h alu.h isa.h
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c cpu.c

        alu.o: alu.c alu.h
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c alu.c

        clean:
            rm -f cpu_simulator *.o
        ```
        To build your project, you would simply run the command `make` in the directory containing your `Makefile`.

*   **ðŸ”² .gitignore - For version control**
    *   **What it is:** `.gitignore` is a file used by Git (a popular version control system).
    *   **Purpose:** To specify files and directories that Git should *ignore* and not track in your repository.
    *   **What it will contain:**
        *   **List of file and directory patterns:**  You'll list patterns that match files and directories you want Git to ignore. Common things to ignore in a C project include:
            *   Object files (`*.o`) - These are intermediate compiled files.
            *   Executable files (`cpu_simulator` or whatever you name your executable).
            *   Temporary files created by your editor or IDE.
            *   Potentially build directories if you use a separate build directory.
    *   **Example Snippet:**
        ```gitignore
        *.o
        cpu_simulator
        *.dSYM  # Debug symbols (macOS)
        *.exe   # Executables (Windows)
        ```
    *   **Why it's important:**  `.gitignore` keeps your Git repository clean by preventing unnecessary files from being tracked. This makes your repository smaller, faster, and easier to manage. You only want to track your source code, `Makefile`, and other essential project files, not the automatically generated build products.

**Implementation Order Explanation**

The suggested implementation order is logical and builds upon dependencies:

1.  **First: ALU (alu.h/alu.c) - The basic building block:** The ALU is the fundamental unit for computation. You need a working ALU before you can implement the CPU core because the CPU will use the ALU to perform operations.

2.  **Second: CPU core (cpu.h/cpu.c) - The main processor logic:** Once you have an ALU, you can start building the CPU core. The CPU core orchestrates the fetch-decode-execute cycle and uses the ALU to perform the actual computations.

3.  **Third: Main program (main.c) - Test program and execution:** After you have the ALU and CPU core implemented, you need a way to test them. `main.c` serves as your test program. You can write simple programs in your simulated assembly language and run them on your simulator to verify that it's working correctly.

4.  **Finally: Build system and documentation:**  The build system (`Makefile`) makes it easy to compile and build your project as you develop it.  Documentation (though not explicitly listed as a file to create, it's implied in "documentation") is important for explaining how your simulator works, how to use it, and the design choices you made.  These are typically done last because you want to have a working simulator first before focusing on these aspects.

**In Summary**

Each of these steps is essential for building a complete and functional CPU simulator. By breaking down the project into these smaller, manageable tasks and following the suggested order, you'll be able to develop your simulator in a structured and organized way. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with creating `alu.h` first, as you suggested!
