Template: Simple Number Guessing Game with Logic Explanation
Concept: Basic programming logic, conditional statements, loops.
Interactive Program Idea: CLI Number Guessing Game:
Program generates a random number.
User guesses a number.
Program provides feedback ("Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").
After each guess, the program could briefly explain the conditional logic used to provide feedback (e.g., "Your guess was higher than the secret number, so the program checked the condition 'guess > secret_number' and found it to be true, hence 'Too high'").
Step-by-Step Tutorial Focus:
Introduction to basic programming concepts like variables, input/output, conditional statements (if/else), loops (while loop for guessing).
