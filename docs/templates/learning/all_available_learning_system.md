## **4. Templates**

### **4.1 Graph Theory Template**

#### **Definitions:**

- **Graph (G):** A set of vertices (\( V \)) connected by edges (\( E \)).
- **Directed Graph:** Edges have a direction associated with them.
- **Weighted Graph:** Edges have weights representing cost or distance.

#### **Key Concepts:**

- **Language Recognition:** Set of strings accepted by an automaton.
- **Regular Expressions:** Algebraic expressions representing regular languages.

#### **Example:**

- **Problem:** Create a DFA that accepts binary strings ending with '01'.
- **Solution:**
  1. Define states to track the last two input bits.
  2. Accept if the final state indicates the last two bits are '0' followed by '1'.

*(Include diagrams, code snippets, and interactive elements as needed)*
