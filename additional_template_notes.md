Graph Theory Template

Definitions:
  - **Graph (G):** A set of vertices (\( V \)) connected by edges (\( E \)).
  - **Directed Graph:** Edges have a direction associated with them.
  - **Weighted Graph:** Edges have weights representing cost or distance.

Key Concepts:
  - **Paths and Cycles:** Sequences of vertices connected by edges.
  - **Connectivity:** Whether a path exists between vertices.
  - **Subgraphs:** Portions of a graph that form a graph themselves.

Example:
  - **Problem:** Determine if a graph is connected.
  - **Solution:**
    - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    - If all vertices are visited, the graph is connected.

Number Theory Template

Definitions:
  - **Prime Numbers:** Integers greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
  - **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** The largest integer that divides two numbers.

Key Concepts:
  - **Euclidean Algorithm:** Efficient method for computing GCD.
  - **Modular Arithmetic:** Arithmetic system for integers where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a modulus.

Example:
  - **Problem:** Find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
  - **Solution:**
    - Apply the recursive formula: \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = \text{GCD}(b, a \mod b) \).

Discrete Probability Template

Definitions:
  - **Experiment:** A procedure that yields one of a possible set of outcomes.
  - **Sample Space (\( S \)):** The set of all possible outcomes.
  - **Event (\( E \)):** A subset of the sample space.

Key Concepts:
  - **Probability of an Event:** \( P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|} \) when outcomes are equally likely.
  - **Conditional Probability:** \( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).
  - **Bayes' Theorem:** Relates conditional probabilities of events.

Example:
  - **Problem:** Calculate the probability of drawing an ace from a deck of cards.
  - **Solution:**
    - \( P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{\text{Number of aces}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \).

Advanced Counting Techniques Template

Principles:
  - **Pigeonhole Principle:** If \( n+1 \) objects are placed into \( n \) boxes, at least one box contains more than one object.
  - **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Accounts for overlapping sets when counting.

Example:
  - **Problem:** In a group of 367 people, prove that at least two share the same birthday.
  - **Solution:**
    - By the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are only 366 possible birthdays (including February 29), at least two people share a birthday.

Logic Circuit Design Template

Definitions:
  - **Logic Gates:** Basic building blocks (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR).
  - **Combinational Circuits:** Output depends only on the current inputs.
  - **Sequential Circuits:** Output depends on current inputs and previous states.

Example:
  - **Problem:** Design a circuit that outputs true only when exactly one input is true.
  - **Solution:**
    - Use an XOR gate, which outputs true when inputs differ.

Automata Theory Template

Definitions:
  - **Finite Automaton:** Abstract machine to recognize patterns within input.
  - **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA):** For each state and input, there's exactly one transition.
  - **Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA):** May have multiple transitions for a state and input.

Key Concepts:
  - **Language Recognition:** Set of strings accepted by an automaton.
  - **Regular Expressions:** Algebraic expressions representing regular languages.

Example:
  - **Problem:** Create a DFA that accepts binary strings ending with '01'.
  - **Solution:**
    - Design states to track the last two input bits and accept if they are '01'.
