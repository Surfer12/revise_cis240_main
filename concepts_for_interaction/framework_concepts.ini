2. Discrete Math + Microarchitecture: A Thematic Linking

2.1 Boolean Algebra → ALU Design
	•	Discrete Math Concept: Boolean algebra, logic gates, truth tables.
	•	Microarchitecture Application:
	•	Define alu.h with function prototypes for basic Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR).
	•	Implement these in alu.c, demonstrating how truth tables translate into C functions.
	•	Interactive Element:
	•	Provide a web-based or CLI tool where students input truth tables, and the code auto-generates the corresponding ALU function skeleton in C.

2.2 Graph Theory → Pipeline Scheduling & Dependency Graphs
	•	Discrete Math Concept: Graph structures, topological sorting, DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).
	•	Microarchitecture Application:
	•	Model pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) as nodes in a graph.
	•	Use topological sort to detect scheduling constraints or hazards.
	•	Illustrate data-dependency edges among instructions.
	•	Interactive Element:
	•	A “pipeline sandbox” that visualizes how instructions move through pipeline stages.
	•	Students can simulate hazards (RAW, WAR, WAW) and see solutions (stall, forwarding).

2.3 Automata Theory → Instruction Decoding and Control
	•	Discrete Math Concept: Finite automata, regular expressions, state machines.
	•	Microarchitecture Application:
	•	CPU control logic can be viewed as a finite state machine.
	•	Instruction decoding transitions among states based on opcode fields (akin to reading symbols in an automaton).
	•	Interactive Element:
	•	A state-machine builder that takes a simplified assembly instruction set (e.g., from isa.h) and auto-generates the code skeleton for cpu_decode_instruction() in cpu.c.

2.4 Set Theory & Combinatorics → Memory Layout and Addressing
	•	Discrete Math Concept: Sets, subsets, Cartesian products, counting principles.
	•	Microarchitecture Application:
	•	Use combinatorial reasoning to design the memory map (division into code segment, data segment, stack).
	•	Demonstrate how addresses can be broken into tag/index/offset sets for caches.
	•	Interactive Element:
	•	Memory simulator that tracks read/write accesses, showing how addresses partition into smaller sets (cache lines, pages).

9. Conclusion

By merging discrete mathematics with microarchitecture in C, students gain a tangible, hands-on understanding of how abstract concepts (e.g., Boolean logic, graph theory, automata) directly influence the real-world engineering of processors and computational systems. Through modular curriculum blocks, interactive labs, and collaborative forums, this unified framework ensures that learners not only grasp theoretical foundations but also develop the practical skills to implement and experiment with their own CPU simulators.

Next Steps
	•	Customize the Modules: Tailor the weekly breakdown, exercises, and complexity of the CPU simulator to match your learners’ backgrounds.
	•	Incorporate More Interactivity: Add live coding demos, auto-graded assignments, or low-level debugging tasks (e.g., stepping through each pipeline stage).
	•	Expand Topics: Explore advanced concepts like branch prediction (probability theory), concurrency (Petri nets or higher-level concurrency graphs), and multi-core systems.

With this integrated approach, both discrete mathematics and C-based microarchitecture become mutually reinforcing, providing students with a holistic and deeply engaging educational experience.
